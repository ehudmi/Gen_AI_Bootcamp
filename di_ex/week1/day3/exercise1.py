# Given this list:


list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]


# find the value 20 in the list, and if it is present, replace it with 200.
# Only update the first occurrence of a value

# if list1.index(20):
#     list1[list1.index(20)] = 200
# print(list1)

# Hint : Look at the index method

# Expected output:
# list1 = [5, 10, 15, 200, 25, 50, 20]

# Exercise

# Unpack the following tuple into 4 variables


# a_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)

# Expected output:

a_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# # Your code

a, b, c, d = a_tuple

print(a, b, c, d)

# print(a) # should print 10
# print(b) # should print 20
# print(c) # should print 30
# print(d) # should print 40
